Why use Excel for RTD data? Excel is a powerful and versatile tool that can handle large amounts of data and perform various calculations and transformations. Excel also has a built-in feature called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) that allows it to communicate with other applications and exchange data in real time. By using Excel as an intermediary, you can get RTD data from any software that supports DDE or RTD protocols, such as Nest, Pi, Fyers One, Dartstock and more.
 
## Steps to get free RTD data from Excel to Amibroker
 
1. Open your software of choice and log in. Create a market watch with the symbols you want to track. Make sure you have a fast and stable internet connection to handle the data flow.
2. Find the option to link your market watch to Excel. This may vary depending on the software you are using. For example, in Pi, you can right-click on any symbol in the market watch and select "link to excel". In Dartstock, you can click on the "link to excel" button in the market watch toolbar.
3. A new Excel file will open with the RTD data from your market watch. Save this file in a convenient location. Note that you must open Excel as an administrator for this step to work.
4. Open Amibroker and create a new database. Choose "Metastock" as the data source and "Local database" as the database settings. Click "Create".
5. In Amibroker, go to File > Database Settings. Under "Data source", select "DDE Universal Plugin". Under "Configure", click on "Browse" and select the Excel file you saved earlier.
6. In the DDE plugin configuration window, select the sheet name where your RTD data is located. Under "Symbol", enter the column name or number where your symbols are listed. Under "Fields", enter the column names or numbers where your price and volume data are listed. You can also specify other fields such as open interest, bid, ask etc. if available.
7. Click on "Test" to see if your data is being imported correctly. If everything is fine, click on "OK" and then "OK" again.
8. In Amibroker, go to File > Import Wizard. Select "Append new quotes to existing symbols". Click on "Pick all" to import all the symbols from your Excel file. Click on "Finish".
9. You should now see your symbols in Amibroker with real-time data from Excel. You can create charts, indicators, scans and more using this data.
