1. Press Windows + R keys to open the Run box and type `regedit`, then press Enter.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\EA Games\Need for Speed(TM) The Run`.
3. Find the value named `Locale` and double-click it.
4. Change the value data to `en_US` for English (US) or `en_GB` for English (UK).
5. Click OK and close the registry editor.
6. Launch the game and enjoy it in English.

## Downloading a Language Pack
 
This method involves downloading a zip file that contains the English language files for the game. You can find this file on various websites, such as Archive.org[^1^] or SoundCloud[^3^]. To download and install the language pack, follow these steps:

1. Download the zip file from one of the links above.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
3. Copy the files inside the folder to your game installation directory, usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Need for Speed(TM) The Run`.
4. Replace any existing files if prompted.
5. Launch the game and enjoy it in English.
